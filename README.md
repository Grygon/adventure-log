# Adventure Log

Ever wanted to have your players handle notes for a session, but everyone's got their own style? Well now you can with Adventure Log! Create a standardized template for all entries within a folder, and have a single button for both GMs and Players to create a journal entry in that folder from the template!

Should be system-independent, but please make an issue if you find any conflicts!
