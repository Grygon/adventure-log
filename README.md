# Adventure Log

Ever wanted to have your players handle notes for a session, but everyone's got their own style? Well now you can with Adventure Log! Create a standardized template for all entries within a folder, and have a single button for both GMs and Players to create a journal entry in that folder from the template!

Should be system-independent, but please make an issue if you find any conflicts!

## Use

To use, first make sure the module is installed and enabled.

Then, right-click and folder and select the "Create Templated Folder" option. This will convert the folder to one that uses a template.

On any templated folder, you should see two things:

* A big "Template" entry.

  * Note that you can rename this however you'd like
  
* A "stamp" button to create an entry from the template

  * You can specify a custom name here, or use the default one of "New Entry"

A demo of v0.1 functionality is here:
