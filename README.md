Ever wanted to have your players handle notes for a session, but everyone's got their own style? Well now you can with Adventure Log! Create a standardized template for all entries within a folder, and have a single button for both GMs and Players to create a journal entry in that folder from the template!

Should be system-independent, but please make an issue if you find any conflicts!

## Use

To use, first make sure the module is installed and enabled.

Then, right-click and folder and select the "Create Templated Folder" option. This will convert the folder to one that uses a template.

On any templated folder, you should see two things:

* A big "Template" entry.

  * Note that you can rename this however you'd like
  
* A "stamp" button to create an entry from the template

  * You can specify a custom name here, or use the default one of "New Entry"
  
  * Note that players need permission to create journal entries to use the stamp

NOTE: All templated folders are visible to players at all times. The content itself is not 
 Currently, entries are created with just the creating player as owner, so other players won't be able to see entries and the GM will have to manually share them. Permissions configuration is one of the first things on my to-do list!
